# S1-RPH-SPAM-FILTER

### Tests
Tests should start with `_test` so as not to clutter the repository and must be located inside the `./tests/` subfolder.

### Testing data
Testing data can be downloaded here: https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/_media/courses/b4b33rph/cviceni/spam/spam-data-12-s75-h25.zip

The program expects the data to be in the `./data/{number}/` subdirectory.
(Anything in the data folder is excluded from the repository.)
